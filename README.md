# CyCAT.org taxonomy

Taxonomy used by CyCAT.org, the Cybersecurity Resource Catalogue, to categorize the namespaces it supports and uses.

# Format

The CyCAT.org taxonomy is [available in JSON format](https://github.com/CyCat-project/cycat-taxonomy/blob/main/json/machinetag.json) and [yaml format](https://github.com/CyCat-project/cycat-taxonomy/blob/main/yaml/machinetag.yaml).

# Goal

The taxonomy will be used on the CyCAT.org portal to classify and label the resources in the catalogue.

# Contributing
